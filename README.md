# PoS-Segmentation-Loyalty

In the highly competitive market we experience currently, companies race over acquiring new customers and keeping them loyal instead of making new ones. Fawry in the e-payment industry needs to effectively apply the loyalty program to merchants in various cities with various business sizes, based on their behavior as there is no attribute to be chosen to reflect loyalty alone, loyalty involves various aspects. In addition, discovering other aspects of the rest of the merchants based on their behavior too, to target them separately. Using RF*M* model for merchants behavior analysis and with the use of various machine learning clustering algorithms, merchants are grouped based on their behavior. Each type will be tackled differently based in their attributes to further improve the revenue generated by them. In addition to an interactive operation dashboard for Fawry to monitor their merchants and KPIs progress per quarter.
